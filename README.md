# GU140X32F-7703A_Adafruit_GFX
Implementation of the base class of the Adafruit_GFX library for the Noritake Itron GU140X32F-7703A VFD



#Acknowledgements
The small font in the static demo is copied from https://github.com/robjen/GFX_fonts, as the library is not yet in the Arduino Library manager. And 140 pixels isn't long enough for a Github URL!
